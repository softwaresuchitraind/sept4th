In order to maintain state of the user We require an explicit programming.
In order to achieve session management explicitely,there r 4 different ways
1.


RequestDispatcher
-----------------------
1.interface
2.forword and i   nclude
3.javax.servlet
4.generic to every protocol
5.there are two ways of getting an object type of the RequestDispatcher

---------
3 different containters

1--Request object
2--HttpSession
3--Context object

-Request object is a container to share the data between the objects which are involved while processing one request.

2-Session object is acting as a container for different requests of one user.
we can use session object to share the data

3-Context object----for entire application there is one context object---if u want to share the data among different user requests
then we will be using servlet context object as a container.

for this 3 containers Servlet-API provided listeners

There are two types of listeners available

1- Life cycle Listeners
2- Attribute Management Listeners


What is a Life cycle Listeners
---------------------------------
Container creation 
Container Destroy

What could be the attribute change Listeners
Attribute Adding Replacing Removing

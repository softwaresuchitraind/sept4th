interface B
{

}

/*

every interface is abstract only.
abstact keyword is optional to interface while declaring.
abstract interface B
{

}
interface can become a member of a java file.
while compileing even for interface also class file is generating.

inside interface we can not develop any concrete members.
inside a interface we can not any defination block-
-no iib,no constuctor,method with defination

Inside a interface we can develop only two types of the members
1--constants
------------
every constant is a static and final.

2--abstract methods


-By default every interface is 100% abstract, u need not specify
explicitly.

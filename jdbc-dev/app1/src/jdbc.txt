	public boolean execute(String sql)-------------->DDL,DML
	public int executeUpdate(String sql) =========>DML------->insert,update and delete
	public ResultSet executeQuery(String sql)===>DQL
	public int[] executeBatch()-------------+
	--------->DML

Even execute() for DML, use executeUpdate for DML as it returns int it shows how many records updated.
If u use batch  multiple DML commands use executeBatch();


JDBC 3.0
----------
1.	New DatabaseMetaData methods
2.	Retrieval of parameter metadata
3.	Retrival of auto-generated keys
4.	Savepoints

JDBC 4.0
--------------
1. ROWID Data type
2. Auto- loading of JDBC driver class
3. SQL exception handling enhancements



1--ROWID Data type

CREATE TABLE EMP3(SNO NUMBER,
		NAME VARCHAR2(90),
		R_ID ROWID);
)

--Only on JDBC 4.0 there is support a column with datatype
as ROWID
-In pagenation read every record with rowid,in last page we have to supply 

-in JDBC 4.0 Rule,whichever driver is current url,if the 
driver is available in the buiild path or classpath
that driver loading autometically.
- if multiple switable drivers are avilable in the same url
then it will get ambiguity exception.
-In that scenario we can specify explicitlely
that can be done in two ways.
we can go for Class.forName
or we can go for second approach.

--
Inside catch block we can read all existing exceptions

for(Thowable t : ex)
{
System.out.println(t);
}

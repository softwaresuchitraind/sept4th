XML
----
* XML is for data storage,describing the data, trasfering the data.
* Xml file can open in any operating system --no need of software.
*it is independent of hardware,software.
* it is not a programming language,it is the standard way for storing the data.

...
*no predefined tags used we have to defined our own tags.
*XML tags are case sensitive <UPPER> NOT SAME AS </lower>
*order should be followed.

* If broqser is displaying in the tree structure then it is well formed XML.
*attributes can be used for meta data.

* any name can be choosen to attribute value.
* every attribute value should be enclosed under double code,

abc2
.....
<!-- 
*attributes can be used for meta data.

* any name can be choosen to attribute value.
* every attribute value should be enclosed under double code,
* for both siblings attribute may be diiferent.
* if multiple attribute are there u have to use space as separator.
*every tag should have ending tag.
* if any tag does not have ending tag then starting tag is ending tag.

-->

-----------------
*From any programming language to interact with XML file that is a small requirement 
that is parser.
*there are lot of parsers available in the industry.
*in case of java lot more parsers are available,among them very widely used parsers 
are
1--DOM-Document object Model
2--SaX- Simple API for XML.

*By using DOM parser we can perform we can write and read.
*SaX parser is used only for reading not for writing.
*In case of DOM parser, internally it is using tree model.
*sax parser is usually using event model.
*In case of DOM parser entire XML file is in the memory in the tree structure because
of this memory overheads.
*In case of SAX parser based on event the reading required portion of the XML file.
*DOM parser not very advisable while interacting with bigger XML files.
*U can read any XML file no matter of size of the file in SAX,there is no chance of 
memory overhead.
* in case of DOM parser we can read the XML File in reverse order because of entire file
is available in the memory.
*in case of SAX parser we can not read the XML file in reverse direction.
*Both parsers are available in the JDK installatiom.based on requirement we have to use.

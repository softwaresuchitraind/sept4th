assertion
...........
assert is a keyword from jdk 1.4
assertions are introduced in jdk 1.4
assertions are used for rising assertion error when something went wrong.
It is almost similar to throw keyword functionality.
--throw statement is always a last statement in the current block
-In java 4 keywords last statement
return
break
continue
throw

--Assertions are only for rising assertion error if something going wrong.
--There are two types of assert statement
1--VSA--Very Simple Assert statement

assert boolean_exp;

2--SA---Simple Assert

assert boolean_exp:some_thing;

*boolean_exp----true/false---can supply boolean variabl---call a method which returns boolean type
*some_thing-----can be any literal/any variable value also/any expression result/method calling statement 
		but return type should not void.
		if u dont supply something cte.

*By default no assert statement is executing.
*In order to execute any assert statement we have to supply one VM argument that VM argument is

-ea (or)   -enableassertions

*to disable assert statement explicitely another assert statement is required.

-da  (or) -disableassertions

-We can enable/disable in three different ways
1---Execution wise
2---a particulr package wise
3---a particular class wise


differ--throw/assert

throw execute every time,there is no chance of enabling and disabling
assert can enable and disable.Any rule does not require to particular person.

*everybody has to evalute the throw
* we can find two groups of people--one group it is mandatory---other not mandatory---assert

*
-throw  is last statement in the current block
like break,continue.
-assert staement can be declared anywhere.

*
By using throw statement we can specify any type of error/Exception statement.
We can not specify any class name in asset explicityely it always throw
AsserionError.




usage
-------
raising AssertionError whenever rule got failed

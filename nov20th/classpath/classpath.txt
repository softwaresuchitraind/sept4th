Classpath 
------------
-classes developed in other project using in current project we require classpath.
-re usablitiy purpose.
F:\>cd F:\app1\src

F:\app1\src>javac -d ../classes lara/A.java

F:\app1\src>cd ../classes

F:\app1\classes>jar cf ../lib/app1.jar *


jar--java Archive
-----------------
-it is similar to zip.
-in java 
jar file is nothing but library.
-jar command is used to create a jar file

F:\app1\src>javadoc -d ../docs lara/A.java
F:\app1\src>javadoc -d ../docs lara/*.java
-if java code contains syntax error then java documentation can not be developed.


-specifying commands location to command prompt is require path.
-Specifying third party clases to the javac command.
-command prompt purpose we r setting path~~~

-cp : classpath
-classpath

path can be set in 3 ways.
4 ways to set classpath

1-for one cmd only

F:\app2\src>javac -d ../classes -cp F:\app1\classes B.java

only for one command not visible to other command---command wise
F:\app2\src>javac -d ../classes -cp F:\app1\lib\app1.jar B.java

2nd way
--------
F:\app2\src>set classpath=F:/app1/classes
- it is only for one command prompt.

F:\app2\classes>java B
Error: Could not find or load main class B

F:\app2\classes>echo %classpath%
F:\app1\lib\app1.jar

-generally java command looking for class file.if class path is set then
-java command serching for every class in the classpath only not in the current directory

-javac command is not looking for class path---if thrid party application.

F:\app2\classes>set CLASSPATH=F:\app1\lib\app1.jar;.
. represents current directory

F:\app2\classes>java B
from app1.lara.A
done

-wherever u update classpath use . at the end

place app1.jar in the following folder

F:\jdk1.8.0_151\jre\lib\ext

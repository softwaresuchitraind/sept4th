   Collection API
--------------

-Addressing the limitations of Array

Limitations of Array
....................

-Array size is fixed , u can not change- once u defined then size can not be changed.
-Arrays are only for storing one type of element--in one array we can store only one type
of element---we can not store multiple type of elements---All elements shold be same type.
-Array exclusively introduced for stoing multiple same type of elemet.
-Manimulating elemnets of an array is very difficult--no built-in methods available.
u can not find switable methods.

-Arrays not having any built-in methods

-Lot of operations required

-Development time increases
-jdk 1.2 onwords uses collection-API
-Based on requirement u should choose one switable method

-In the collection API 4 strings available

1.List
2.Queue
3.Set
4.Map


		 ---------------Collections---------
		 |		    |		 |	 |
		List		  Queue		Set	Map
		  |	/           |		  |
	      AL,V,LL		   PQ         HS, LHS, SS
						      |
						      NS
						      |
						      TS


* Map is not a type of collection

				Map
				 |
		HashMap,HashTable,LinkedHashMap --classes  | sortedMap --Interface
								|
							     NavigableMap--Interface
								|
							     TreeMap---Class


-In TreeMap sorting is based on keys
---<U have to sort all the based on the values>


HashSet,LinkedHashSet---class implementing Set
SortedSet is a interface --it is extending with the Set interface.
NavigableSet is another interface extending with SortedSet
TreeSet is a class implimenting NavigableSet interface.


-In AL,V and LL,sorting can be done collection.sort()
-PriorityQueue ,AutoSorting no need to cal any method
-All these 4 are interfaces
-List,Queue,Set extending Collection,Collection is also an interface
-Map is not extending to Collection but Map is also a part of Collection framework.
-Entire collection framework available in the java.util package

-What is the Significane of List
-
List
...

-List is ordered Collection.
-order of addition is preserving in the list
what is the meaing of preserving--same order u will get in the order u adding.

-Inside a list every element is assigning with one unique index.
-While adding 1st 0 index and onwords
-we donot specify index number while adding .
autometically indexes are providing.
-List is allowing duplicates
-List is allowing null values
-Inside a list 3 important classes

		1.ArrayList
		2.Vector
		3.LInkedList

-All are implimenting List interface.
-3 are the concrete classes
-LinkedList is also a type of Queue also.

called as live object.

2.Abandoned Object
-------------------

-If object does not have a single reference variable  then that 
object is called dead object or abandoned object.


-Abandoned objects are eligible for garbage collection.
-finalise() method is the last step in the object life cycle.

-Garbage collector call finalise() method maximum one time.

-resurected object--gets life that object is not called finalise().
-Abdoned object is not removing from heap memory as soon as
it is called by garbage collector.
it is calling finalise() method and removing that from memory.


-System.gc();

enabling/disabling
1-execution wise
2-package wise 
3-in a paricular class


enabling in all the classes
G:\nov20th\assert-dev\src>java -cp ../classes -ea pack1.L


disabling in all the classes
G:\nov20th\assert-dev\src>java -cp ../classes -da pack1.L


only from pack2 members
G:\nov20th\assert-dev\src>java -cp ../classes -ea:pack2... pack1.L

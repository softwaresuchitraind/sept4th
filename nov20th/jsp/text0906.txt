we have seen html and servlets
-In html we can present any UI related but jave code can not be incorporated in java code.
-In case of Servlets we can incorporate java concepts.
-presenting data in the servlet is not recommended.
-in order to address the limitations of both html and servlet ,introduced jsp.
-Every html file can be renamed as jsp.
we can introdued java file in the jsp.
-JSP---JAVA SERVER PAGES
-------------------------------
-Every HTML file can be renamed as JSP.
-Presentation is vey easy in jsp
-Inside a jsp there are multiple ways to incorporate java file.
-There are multiple ways to incorporate java code inside jsp.

There are 4 different ways to incorporate java code inside jsp

1--expressions ------printing
2--Scriplet---------part of the method-executeable content
3-Delarations
4-Directives
--------------
there are 3 types of directives available

1-page
2-include
3-taglib


-in order to import we use page directive.

implicit objects		datatypes
--------------                  ----------
pageContext			pageContext
session				HttpSession
application			ServletContext
config				ServletConfig
out				JspWriter
page				Object(this)
request				HttpServletRequest
response			HttpServletResponse
exception			Throwable


-All the implicit objects can be used in the straightway.
-exception implicit objects available only in the error pages.

-Inside HttpJspBase 3 methods are final
1-init()
2-service()
3-destroy()
-

-we can not develop those three methods in our jsp.The reason is those 3 methods
are final in HttpJspBase.

- _jspinit(), _jspService, _jspdestroy() is autometically developed by server.
we can not develop in our jsp.

_ methods exclusively for server. These methods autometically implemented by server.

-in our jsp we can not develop 6 methods, those methods
are above.

How to achieve initialisation and house keeping activity inside jsp ?

-In order to achive any initialisation try to overide jspinit() methood
-in order to use any house keeping activities use jspdestroy() method.
-

Life_Cycle of JSP
--------------------

-jsp life cycle is nothing but Servlet life cycle.
-While making a call to jsp 1st time


-Directives and declarations are not in the _jspService
-Apart from directives and declarations remaining complete content of jsp incorporating in _jspService


-Servlets are for bussiness logic and jsp is for presentation.

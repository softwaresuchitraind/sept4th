we have seen html and servlets
-In html we can present any UI related but jave code can not be incorporated in java code.
-In case of Servlets we can incorporate java concepts.
-presenting data in the servlet is not recommended.
-in order to address the limitations of both html and servlet ,introduced jsp.
-Every html file can be renamed as jsp.
we can introdued java file in the jsp.
-JSP---JAVA SERVER PAGES
-------------------------------
-Every HTML file can be renamed as JSP.
-Inside a jsp there are multiple ways to incorporate java file.
-There are multiple ways to incorporate java code inside jsp.
http://localhost:7070/jsp-app1/test1.jsp

There are 4 different approches to provide java code inside jsp

Declarations
------------------
excpressions
Scriplets

these three are called scripting element of jsp.

directives
-------------

there are 3 type of directives available

-for every jsp there is one java file generated by server.

jsp--day2
---------

HttpServlet
   |
HttpJspBase
   |
test1_jsp

*What is the super class to every servlet class ?
Ans :- HttpServlet

search ---HttpJspBase source code

--6 methods can not be developed in jsp
init()
service()
destroy()
_jspInit()
_jspService()
_jspDestory()

-- inside jsp Except directives and declarations remaining all code shold be 
kept in _jspService.

F:\Tomcat8.0\work\Catalina\localhost\jsp-app1\org\apache\jsp

-- every plain text,expression,scriplt goes to _jspService() in the same order
after some definations.

-Is it possible to declare a method in the Scriplet ?
no
--We can not develop any method inside a scriplet.

-In jsp how develop initialization/house keeping method ?
-in our declaration we can overide declare jspinit() and jspDestory(). 

-JSP lifecycle
------------------

1-Traslation phase

-jsp file jsp file to java file.
-jsp file is converted into java file

2-compilation phase
3--object creation
4--init()
5--service()----_jspService -----destroy()

jsp class-3
-----------------
there are 3 types of directives availabel
1--page directive
2--include directive
3--taglib directive

2--include directive
-------------------------
-We can not include Servlet and jsp.
action include

through action include we can not share the variables between the jsp even though order is following.


directive include and action include
------------------------------------
-Directive include is static,action inlude is dynamic.
-in case of directive include u can not call to servelt we can call to.
-directive happens in compile time and action occurs in runtime.
-order should be follwed in directive but not possible in action.

Day-3
-----------
ecclipse
F:\ecclipse-oxy-dev-servlet1\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core
F:\ecclipse-oxy-dev-servlet1\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0\work\Catalina\localhost\jsp-app1\org\apache\jsp
location of class file & java file

-through action include we can supply some parameter to the target

-scriplets and expressions goes to _service() after default statements



implicit Objects		Datatypes
-----------------		----------
request				HttpServletRequest
response			HttpServletResponse
pageContext			PageContext
session				HttpSession
application			ServletContext
config				ServletConfig
out				JspWriter
page				this(Object)
exception			Thowable
	
-These are called implicit objects to jsp developer. It can be used without declaration,
without defination
-there are 9 implicit objects
-Among these 9, last implicit object is not a default.it is available only in the error pages.

- In jsp declarations we can not use implicit objects.Why ?
Every implicit object is local to _jspservice(),So it can not be used in parallel methods.
whichever portion goes to _jspService we can use.
delarations are global members.

-If scope is page use-bean is stored in page object.
-If scope is request use-bean is stored in request object. 

-application stands for inplicit object to ServletContext.
-servlet context is global to entire application.

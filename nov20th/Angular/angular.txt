- by using java script we can validate data.
-dveloping java script is very lenthy.
-reusing is very difficult.
-lot of functions has to develop
-java script is not a pure object oriented language.
-Debugging,testing very very difficult.
-java script functions very difficult.
-oraganizing multiple java script functions very difficult.
-debugging, testing is difficult.
-customer requrirement is very difficult.
-Jquery---2007--13,14,15 using Jquery
-Jquery is framework building on top of the java script.
-from the Jqury library lot of built-in functions
-development time can be reduced.
-organizing,debugging,testing  difficult.
-jQuery is noting but one java script file .
-problem with object orientd.
-Afterwords Angular is used. It is similar to Jquey.it 1.0 version.
-2010 Angular js is used.
-it is switable for both browser based and mobile based client.
-Because of that it is more popular.
-Object orented is missing,organizing,testing etc is difficult.
-

2016,Another verson of Angular2.
Angular js and Angular 2 is entirely different. there is no comparision 
between angular js and Angular2.
-Angular2 using type Script is one of the Object orientd programming.
-Typescript is a super set of java script.
-Any valid java script code valid in type script also.
-Every browser knows only java scipt.
-No browser knows type script.
-Type script compiler will be transferd into java script code.
Angular js 
2.0,2.1,2.2,2.3
....................not 2.4 **** straightway 4.0
-The resons in inside angular several modules are there  haveing several versions.
-Every modules having reutter module 3.3
-To avoid confusion they release 4.0
--It release 2017
-immediately after 5.o
-UI development.
-type script.
-UI developer/Full Stack Developer


-Node server
-----------------
NPM---Node packageing module
-It can download any kind of java script libraries.
-NPM tool- it is taking care of downloading java script code.
-biggest source is java script code.
-to interact with the node server we should require command based client.(CLI)
command lable interface
-Throgh the command based client 
-editor     <Editplus/eclipse>
-we shold go for IDE type--Visual Source Code
https://nodejs.org/en/
node.js
............
E:\nodejs\

Command prompt
--------------
>node --version
>npm install -g @angular/cli
//npm is one of the tool available in node server
//to install angular cli
//npm angular based client
//through npm based we can make a server based.

if u want to uninstall

>npm uninstall -g @angular/cli

After installation take it out whether installation is proper or not.

>ng --version


editor
................

https://code.visualstudio.com/

E:\MicrosoftVSCode
-u can call IDE not editor

Download--save
install in -----E:\microsoftvscode
-unchech lunch visual studio code
>cd angular2
angular4>ng new hello
project hello createrd
>cd hello
open a new command prompt to recocgnize new path
G:\angular4\hello> code .
E:\angular4\hello> echo %path%
E:\angular4\hello> ng serve
compiled successfully
go to browser
http://localhost:4200/

Day2
--------
e2e--end to end
mainly for test case purpose
node_modules
--------
only for third party libraries
src-place to develop source code
-
inside src
components and modules
....
component is a combination of presentation logic ,html mark up
and the data.
-one component containing css also and data.
This component can reuse in the same project or in the other projects
-multiple components making one module.
-module containing multiple components.
-Inside app there is one component and one module.
-componet css,html,processing and data,presentatipn
-component having three different files

1-css--cosmetic components
2-html
3-type script file--app.component.ts
this is used for programming or processing any logic
--to store or maintaing the data
-we will be developing the class-model data-bethaviour

-In any programming lanh=guage boot strapping methos

main.ts----boot stapping/main executing file
index.html---welcome file

Typescript
----------
E:\angular2\type-script>npm install -g typescript
E:\angular2\type-script>tsc --version
E:\angular2\type-script>code test1.ts
E:\angular2\type-script>tsc test1.ts
E:\angular2\type-script>dir

E:\angular2\type-script>node test1.js
hello to all


--in case of java script single character data type is not there .
u have to specify single code or

E:\angular2\type-script>code test2.ts
E:\angular2\type-script>tsc test2.ts
E:\angular2\type-script>dir
E:\angular2\type-script>node test1.js


There is a clear difference between var and let.
-both var and let available in typescript and java script.
-In any programming languages 
var key word is available in outside the block but in the current function.
-var scope is a nearest function,let scope is a nearest block.

constraints
-similar kind of fixed constants we can use enum.

-usage of typescript class in another file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-In case of angular every development in a component.
\angular4\typescript\app5>tsc hello1.ts

G:\angular4\typescript\app5>node hello1.js
Hello to all

G:\angular4\typescript\app5>cd ..

G:\angular4\typescript>cd ..

G:\angular4>mkdir components

G:\angular4>cd components

G:\angular4\components>ng new g app1

>dir
>ng new app1

thease components to be registered in the moddule.

app.component.ts
------------------
prgramming ---processing-display logic 

-component is one of the built in type script class.
-while using any builtin class we have to use with library.


import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'app';
}

-we have to decorate our component through components.
-one component can have any css files.

G:\angular4\components>cd app1

G:\angular4\components\app1>code .

G:\angular4\components\app1>ng serve
G:\angular4\components\app1>ng g c hello



template: '<h1>Hello to all,{{title}}</h1>',
this is called interpolation.
-
components
logic,programming ,processing,data modelling
-this component can be reused wherever u want.

Singleton
------------
-create one object,keep using same objet whereever required.

ctrl+shift+i ----console

21-02
-------
package.json
5.2.0

^---maximmum
2--minor
0--patch nos

-explaning about libraries and versions in the current project
-install boot stap library
-downloading any open source commaned

>npm
downloading and installing specified library inside our project

>npm install bootstrap --save

--save is used for updating in the package.json

node_modules
----------

third party modules and libraries.
~ ---dilti

-inorder to refer any libraries in node_module u have to use ~

class binding
--------------

Style-binding

22*02*18-not working
---------------


23-02-18
-----------
Two way binding
-changes in the view reflecting in console.
-We have to import forms module explicitely.

Difference be

<div> is producing a new line
<span> after executing control is in the same line.

-null is used in submersive purpose in UI development.
-Exception message fully submersive in UI.

Which portion of webapplication can be developed using angular
frontend portion

-Type script code trs[aring/compiling to js code and then js code
is running into browsers memory.

How to run java script code ouside a browser ?
-By using node command from the node server

What is the typescript compiler command name ?
tsc 

What are the keywords used for declaring a local variable?
var and let

what is the difference between var and let ?
1-var is a local to the current function/method.
2-let is a local to the currnt defination block.

-var is used to assign any datatype value.
let is used for only one type of the value.


What are the datatypes available in the type scriprt ?
Number
String
boolean
any

-This datatype is only for arguments and global variables not for local variab;e
-If any argument or datatype is not specified default is int.

How to represents constants in the typescript ?
There are two ways available.
const
enum

------------------
-in place of jdbc we will using hibernate.
Advantages
------------
concepts of hiberanate
-----------------------
-In case of jdbc ,it is a library is not a framework.

Query API
----------------
-to read specific type of queries.
-Under query API two types of queries
-It uses two type of queries.
1--HQL -Hibernate Query Language
2--SQL--Structured Query language

-In the hibernate Query language u should use class name in place of table name.We have to use 
attribute name of a class in place of column name of the table.

inside a pojo class we can do configuration that we do in hbm file that configuration
is called Anotation configuration/programatic configuration.

retention policy = runtime

Any annotation having retention policy as runtime--whenever person is loading all
annotation is loading.

is -a relation ship.

-polymorphism------------------subclass object assigned to superclass.
Pojo classes under one relation
-whereever is- a- relation ship is there we can achieve polimorphism.

Annotations mapping

polimorphic mappings
Association mapping

one-to- one bidirectional

index is only for Arrays and lists

Collection Mapping
one- to--many


unidirectional/Bidirectional
-------
Through annotations

unidirectional annotation mapping

Many- to-one

many - to - many
bidirectional

Assocication mappings
-------------------
uni/ni

--only in case of many -to -many 
bidirectional is avialable.

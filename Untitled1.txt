assertion
...........
assert is a keyword from jdk 1.4
assertions are introduced in jdk 1.4
assertions are used for rising assertion error when something went wrong.
It is almost similar to throw keyword functionality.
--throw statement is always a last statement in the current block
-In java 4 keywords last statement
return
break
continue
throw

--Assertions are only for rising assertion error if something going wrong.
--There are two types of assert statement
1--VSA--Very Simple Assert statement

assert boolean_exp;

2--SA---Simple Assert

assert boolean_exp:some_thing;

*boolean_exp----true/false---can supply boolean variable--
-call a method which returns boolean type
*some_thing-----can be any literal/any variable value also/any expression 
result/method calling statement but return type should not void.
if u dont supply something cte.

*By default no assert statement is executing.
*In order to execute any assert statement we have to supply one VM argument that VM argument is

-ea (or)   -enableassertions

*to disable assert statement explicitely another assert statement is required.


-da  (or) -disableassertions
